        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <div class="content-div">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The idea of this learning plan is to create a plan of how I see the next 14-15 weeks of my life going and what I want to happen after the completion of this.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="content-div">
            <h2>My Career Goal</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I'm still employeed and taking a career break so I have a direct short term goal after comlpeting this course. My long-term goal is a bit cloudy I need to see if I really enjoy this line of work.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><span class="goal">Short Term Goal:</span> I want to be able to go back to my current employeer and utilize the skills and knowledge gained from this course to make advancements in what I could produce before this course. I was given assurances when they offered me a career break that I would have some pathways setup to use the skills and progress to the Dev side if that's what I wanted.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><span class="goal">Long Term Goal:</span> My long term goal is to have web devlopment in-grained in my career. I want to contiously gain new skills and build upon them. Honestly I'm not sure if I want a career that is 100% web development but I know I want it to be part of my career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-div">
            <h2>Strenghts, Limitations & Growth</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">My greatest strength comes from Passion. If I am passionate about something it almost becomes all consuming. The problem with that is I tend to veer off course sometimes. I will go down those rabbit holes and start looking at components that I do not need.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A limitation of mine is time managment. Im historically very poor at time management, all through Uni I was the caffine addict staying up 2 nights in a row to write a paper. Personally I feel like I have gotten better at time management since working in a presure environment. The reason I think this is because I hate disapointing people, so my concern is that now that the outcomes of this are solely going to impact myself. I don't want to fall back into an old behaviour. I go into this more in my learning and how I want to combat this. Also this learning plan creation came at the right time feel myself slipping.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">How do I want to Grow</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">My main priority for soft skills growth is collaboration. Historically I have had really bad collaboration experinces stemming from UNI projects that have made really dislike collaboration. Some of which may have been partly my fault in not trying enough to colloberate.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Another one is confidence. Not Ego but confidence in speaking up and questioning a way of doing something.</p> 
        </div>

        <div class="content-div">
            <h2 >How will I manage</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">How I plan my Days</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I want to by consistient in my days. In some previous analyis I think my best time to work is in the morning fresh out of bed with the distractions of the outside world easily being tuned out.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My plan is to start every day at 7am and work through to 4pm. The first part of the day I want to commit to learning new things where I can focus better and retain information. The second part of the idealy is used to put that into practice. This is where I need to be actively doing something in order for me to focus.</p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">When it goes it wrong <span class="use">{Hope for the best plan for the worst}</span></h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Where I see myself going wrong is in time boxing and meeting objectives. I tend to over complicate things and need to focus on the task at hand. One thing I have been doing in order to combat this is by writting down the objectives from the foundations handbook and having that visible on my screen at all times.</p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Asking for Help</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I never ask for help, personally I view myself when I ask for help as not good enough. When I see others do that it never pops in to my head. I have a strict sort of internaly policy when it comes to asking for help. Ask once how that's fine don't ask again. My commimetent to asking for help, is to try first. I want to try and figure it out for myself in a <span class="bodl">timely</span> manner. But after that I want to not be afraid to ask for help, be that my fellow cohort members or my facilator.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Looking at all the projects that people have been working on its evident that there is a lot of skilled people in this programe with skills leaps above my own. To not use there help through the slack channels would be a waste.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Joesph my foundations facilator is another resource I can use for questions and help. Also I hope I never have to do this but I can talk with him and if I have any challanges completing something there may be the option to have some sort of extension</p>
            <p class="breakline">Extensions are a short term soloution and the last thing I want to be doing is playing catchup</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="content-div">
            <h2>What are my expectations from my facilator</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">The facilator sessions are for Me</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In my first catchup I was made aware that these sessions are for me and led my be. Very different to what I expected. For the next session I have I want to give it some structure, what was I struggling with and where he may be able to help out.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Expectations</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My main expectation is feedback, I want to use it as time to talk through the project I am working on for that week. I will have issues things never go smoothly and I want to talk with him around how I can solve this or do better.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Also want to use the time as a place to have general discussions. The first one was good he re assured me about some dificulties I was having with CSS. There will be doubts and this is the time to express them.</p>
