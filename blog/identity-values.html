            <h2>An Ethical Deceision</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Golf Competition</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I played Golf somewhatt competively as a kid. I got matched up to play against one of my younger selfs golfing role models that belonged to the club. We where good mates and get a long well. We where playing the third to last hole of our match, I was two up with three to play. My opponent got in some trouble near the trees and wanted relief/move-away from it. It was a tough internal decesion for me to say no you don't get relief. If it was any other time and it was a casual game, I would just say yes. Needless to say I felt very guilty I felt like a betrayed a friend and what I did was wrong. I kept telling myself its just the rules its not my fault. I won the match because of this. No one ever gave me any stick for this they all undestood that it's the rules but I still feel like it was wrong. To me that's ethics, even when you justify a decesion to be the correct one there is still another branch of ethics to say that was not the right decesion.</p>

            <h2>A Collaborative Example</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Worst collobrative Experince</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In my final year of Uni we had a project worth 50% of grade for three subjects to present at the end of the year. This project was not good in the slightest. The fact we passed was a shock to me geniuely. When I colloborate with others there is a pattern of the people in the group. There is the leader, unspoken but everyone knows its that person. That was me for some reason and I really tried to get them to work together. The issue was to many of our group did not give a shit. To be far they said that from the start. "BuT wE hAD To PrE$enT CoLaboRATiveLY". Some personal issues come up and I had to go to a funeral. I told the teachers and they said you need to be there can you still come. I said I'd come for our presentation then leave and they agreed. So all good. We tried to plan a presentation and rehease but only three out of 6 showed up for them. So I kept talking with saying them that you need to present this and you have 4 mins for each section we can't go over as the time limits are strict. Long story short they all go over 4 minutes some not by that much some present for 8 mins. So we get cut short and I present nothing. Not gonna lie I was pissed and just walked out the class and shut the door behind me. I was not proud of it, but thought it was a better option then talking to others in my group. Then had to drive down to Tauragna for the funeral, I did not miss the service but I should have been there with my Family before hand.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Strategry</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My main thinking now when it comes to collobartive projects is that everyone needs to have a similar level of desire to complete the project. In my job we work in Agile environment and geniuely the collobrative work that goes on there is great. I really believe that this happens because everyone wants to succeed and has a similar threshold of what success is.</p>
